## Q1: A Plus Abs B 


Fill in the blanks in the following function for adding a to the absolute value of b, without calling abs. You may not modify any of the provided code other than the two blanks.


```python
from operator import add, sub

def a_plus_abs_b(a, b):
    """Return a+abs(b), but without calling abs.

    >>> a_plus_abs_b(2, 3)
    5
    >>> a_plus_abs_b(2, -3)
    5
    """
    if b < 0:
        f = sub
    else:
        f = add
    return f(a, b)
```

>2+3   
2-(-3)
 
## Q2: Two of Three
Write a function that takes three positive numbers and returns the sum of the squares of the two largest numbers. Use only a single line for the body of the function.
```python
def two_of_three(a, b, c):
    """Return x*x + y*y, where x and y are the two largest members of the
    positive numbers a, b, and c.

    >>> two_of_three(1, 2, 3)
    13
    >>> two_of_three(5, 3, 1)
    34
    >>> two_of_three(10, 2, 8)
    164
    >>> two_of_three(5, 5, 5)
    50
    """
    return ((a*a)+(b*b)+(c*c))-((min(a,b,c))*(min(a,b,c)))
```
>先找三个数的平方和，再减去最小数的平方
## Q3: Largest Factor
Write a function that takes an integer n that is greater than 1 and returns the largest integer that is smaller than n and evenly divides n.

```python
def largest_factor(n):
    """Return the largest factor of n that is smaller than n.

    >>> largest_factor(15) # factors are 1, 3, 5
    5
    >>> largest_factor(80) # factors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40
    40
    >>> largest_factor(13) # factor is 1 since 13 is prime
    1
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
    a=0
    for i in range(n):
        if n%i == 0:
            a=max(a,i)
    return int(a)  

```
>写循环求出能被n整除的数，再跟之前的比较，找出最大的数然后返回

## Q4: If Function vs Statement
Let's try to write a function that does the same thing as an if statement.

```python
def if_function(condition, true_result, false_result):
    """Return true_result if condition is a true value, and
    false_result otherwise.

    >>> if_function(True, 2, 3)
    2
    >>> if_function(False, 2, 3)
    3
    >>> if_function(3==2, 3+2, 3-2)
    1
    >>> if_function(3>2, 3+2, 3-2)
    5
    """
    if condition:
        return true_result
    else:
        return false_result
```
Despite the doctests above, this function actually does not do the same thing as an if statement in all cases. To prove this fact, write functions c, t, and f such that with_if_statement prints the number 2, but with_if_function prints both 1 and 2.
```python
def with_if_statement():
    """
    >>> result = with_if_statement()
    2
    >>> print(result)
    None
    """
    if c():
        return t()
    else:
        return f()

def with_if_function():
    """
    >>> result = with_if_function()
    1
    2
    >>> print(result)
    None
    """
    return if_function(c(), t(), f())

def c():
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
    return False
def t():
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
    print(1)

def f():
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
    print(2)


```
>函数调用：  
>先调用里面的在执行外面的。`with_if_function`执行时，先调用了 c , t , f  再调用`if_function`而在调用时直接打印出了1和2


## Q5: Hailstone
Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize-winning book, Gödel, Escher, Bach, poses the following mathematical puzzle.

+ Pick a positive integer n as the start.

+ If n is even, divide it by 2.

+ If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

+ Continue this process until n is 1.

The number n will travel up and down but eventually end at 1 (at least for all numbers that have ever been tried -- nobody has ever proved that the sequence will terminate). Analogously, a hailstone travels up and down in the atmosphere before eventually landing on earth.

This sequence of values of n is often called a Hailstone sequence. Write a function that takes a single argument with formal parameter name n, prints out the hailstone sequence starting at n, and returns the number of steps in the sequence:
```python
def hailstone(n):
    """Print the hailstone sequence starting at n and return its
    length.

    >>> a = hailstone(10)
    10
    5
    16
    8
    4
    2
    1
    >>> a
    7
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
    a=0
    while(n!=1):
        print(n)
        a+=1
        if n%2==0:
            n=n/2
            
        else:
            n=(n*3)+1
    print("1")
    return a
    

```
>使用循环直到n=1，加一个if else 算出是奇数还是偶数，并执行相应条件。在if else前打印出当前a的值，并将步数a+1。最后再返回步数a
